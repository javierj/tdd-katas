 Kata FizzBuzz (link) 
=========================================================

Using Java.

Folder *src* contains source code, folder *test* contain test cases.

This is not a final version. However you could use this version to evaluate the impact of a new requirement (7 = Wizz), the readability of the code (is this clean code?) and to identify a set of re factorizations.

File *FizzBuzzExpectedUsage* shows and idea of how could be a good solution. In this case, adding a new requirement is done adding a new filter without modifying existing code.
